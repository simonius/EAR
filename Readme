These files hold the testcases for the publication "Entropy-aware non-oscillatory high-order finite volume methods using the Dafermos entropy rate criterion".
Please note that also functions for PA operator based schemes are included here but only one version was included in the publication to reduce overlength.


List of files:
	* burgflux.jl: 		Holds the fluxes for Burgers' equation
	* burgparam.jl: 	Global parameters for the test cases
        * derhoes.jl:
	* mkconvana.jl:		Performs a convergence analysis when included
	* mkpictures.jl:	Produces images of numerical tests to show the shock-capturing abilities
	* solvers.jl: implementation of solvers
	* recon.jl
